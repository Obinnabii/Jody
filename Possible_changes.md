- [ ] We can add a way to load functions in from txt files.
- [ ] We could create while loops. Very easy imlementation.
- [ ] We could allow for variables because all functions are in closures so changing
variable should keep integrity.
- [ ] While loops are only useful if we have mutable variables. (also, this is an easy 
extension to the language. It is a way to temporarily change the environment
for use in sequences because while loops are esentially sequences.) we can limit
the scope of mutabilty to a single sequence evaluation. I think this would be a 
really cool way to keep dynamic functional integrity while allowing our language
to be decently powerful
- [ ] Persisting values and writing code that lasts seems like a daunting task
