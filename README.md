# Jody

## Overview
We intend to create a language that has automatic memoization, allowing dynamic programming algorithms to be written using recursion, but actually cache results under the hood.

#### Key Features
- Basic functional programming language features including: constants, variables, first-order functions(regular, anonymous, and recursive), boolean operators, unary operators, basic arithmetic, and if expressions
- A simple but powerful data structure -> pairs
- Low mem mode as a sort of rudimentary garbage collection system
- A system timer to see how much of the systems time was used on a particular block of code. This will serve as proof of efficiency and an aide for programmers who are concerned about efficient JoDy code.
- A display mode that shows the state of a dynamic programsâ€™ memoization one each computation. This will serve as an aide for debugging.
- A `dyn` function modifier that enables automatic memoization

We intend to build a language with features to help simplify memoization in recursion. Our plan is to implement a language inspired by JoCalf and add many features (a complete list is below). The most important of which is the dyn function modifier that automatically saves solutions to recursive problems. Memoization works by using a data structure that maps inputs to previously computed outputs. Our plan is to create this table under the hood of JoDy so that programmers do not actually have to instantiate any tables or make checks to tables. 

#### How to Run

To make the interpreter run `make repl`

Example program
```
|-              // start timer
let x = 3 in x
-|              // end timer (returns ms of CPU time since start)
```

Look in the test file for more code examples.

#### Commands
```
#quit           ->      Quit the repl
#env            ->      Print the environment representation (shows all the 
                        variable and function assignments)
#display        ->      Toggles the visibility of an input's memoization status 
                        when running dynamic functions. 
#lowmem         ->      Toggles low memory mode which restricts the amount
                        of results that can be cached/memoized for a dynamic function.
