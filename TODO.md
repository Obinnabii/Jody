- [x] We could allow for variables because all functions are in closures so changing
variable should keep integrity.
- [ ] While loops are only useful if we have mutable variables. (also, this is an easy
extension to the language. It is a way to temporarily change the environment
for use in sequences because while loops are esentially sequences.) we can limit
the scope of mutabilty to a single sequence evaluation. I think this would be a
really cool way to keep dynamic functional integrity while allowing our language
to be decently powerful
- [ ] Persisting values and writing code that lasts seems like a daunting task
- [x] Delete authors.ml
- [ ] Allow for functions to be loaded into the environment before the interpreter runs. (can also be done using a load/import keyword)
- [ ] add file extension `.jd`
